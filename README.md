# RSA and Factoring
This repository contains number-theoretic algorithms used for RSA key generation and factoring,
This project was for my Design and Analysis of Algorithms class at UMBC.

## NOTES
1. The python files were all _initially_ programmed and tested in Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Installation of _big_ modules/softwares may be required to run some of the programs/files. We recommend running only the python file ```factoring.py``` if you do not want to install anything else. As all other programming files contain the same information.
