# RSA and Factoring
This repository contains number-theoretic algorithms used for RSA key generation and factoring,

This project was for my Design and Analysis of Algorithms class at UMBC that I took in Spring 2022. 

**This project received a grade of 135/140 (A+)**, most parts were graded on the correctness and efficiency of algorithms and part 1b was graded on completion.

## NOTES
1. The python files were all _initially_ programmed and tested in Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Installation of _big_ modules/softwares may be required to run some of the programs/files. We recommend running only the python file ```factoring.py``` if you do not want to install anything else. As all other programming files contain the same information.
