## MODIFICATIONS MADE TO RSA KEYGEN ALGORITHM
1. The parameters passed into ```GENERATE_PRIME``` for ```p``` on line 84 was floor divided by 2.
2. The parameters passed into ```GENERATE_PRIME``` for ```q``` on line 85 was also floor divided by 2.

## ASSOCIATED TEXT FILES
1. ```modulus.txt``` --> Contains the RSA modulus that I am officially submitting for Part 1b.

## NOTES
1. The size of the modulus is **155**.
2. The factorization for my submitted modulus (the modulus in the file: ```modulus.txt```) is: **98027061218045251949147** and **27922806046779182831917**.
3. In order to run the ```updated_rsa.py``` code, the associated text files from part 1a will be needed.
